# Phase II Frontend Web App Tasks

## User Input
```

```

## Response Summary
Generated comprehensive task list for Phase II Frontend Web Application with 34 tasks organized across 6 phases:

- Phase 1: Setup (3 tasks) - Project initialization
- Phase 2: Foundational (6 tasks) - Blocking prerequisites for all user stories
- Phase 3: User Story 1 - User Authentication (P1 - MVP) - 7 tasks
- Phase 4: User Story 2 - View and Manage Tasks (P1) - 11 tasks
- Phase 5: User Story 3 - Responsive UI Experience (P2) - 5 tasks
- Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns - 4 tasks

Tasks follow the required format with checkboxes, sequential IDs, parallelization markers [P], and user story labels [US1-US3]. Each user story is organized to be independently implementable and testable.

## Outcome
- Created complete task list at `specs/003-frontend-web-app/tasks.md`
- Created quality checklist at `specs/003-frontend-web-app/checklists/requirements.md`
- Organized tasks by user story priority (P1, P1, P2)
- Aligned with all functional requirements from specification
- Included proper dependencies and parallel execution opportunities
- Provided implementation strategy for MVP and incremental delivery

## Evaluation
The task list is complete and ready for implementation. All tasks follow the required format and organization by user story. Each user story can be implemented and tested independently, with clear dependencies and checkpoints for validation. The project is ready for the implementation phase.
