# Phase II Backend API Tasks

## User Input
```

```

## Response Summary
Generated comprehensive task list for Phase II Backend API & Data Layer implementation. The tasks are organized in phases following the user story priorities from the specification:

- Phase 1: Setup (project initialization)
- Phase 2: Foundational (core infrastructure - database, models, routing)
- Phase 3: User Story 1 - Create Todo Tasks (P1 - MVP)
- Phase 4: User Story 2 - Retrieve Todo Tasks (P1)
- Phase 5: User Story 3 - Update and Complete Todo Tasks (P2)
- Phase 6: User Story 4 - Delete Todo Tasks (P2)
- Phase 7: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

Each task follows the required format with checkboxes, sequential IDs, parallelization markers [P], and user story labels [US1-US4]. Tasks are organized by priority and enable independent implementation and testing of each user story.

## Outcome
- Created complete task list at `specs/001-backend-api-data-layer/tasks.md`
- Organized 30 tasks across 7 phases
- Aligned with all 4 user stories from the specification
- Included proper dependencies and parallel execution opportunities
- Provided implementation strategy for MVP and incremental delivery

## Evaluation
The task list is complete and ready for implementation. All tasks follow the required format and organization by user story. Each user story can be implemented and tested independently, with clear dependencies and checkpoints for validation.
